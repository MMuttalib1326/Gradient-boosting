# Gradient-boosting
What is gradient boosting regression in machine learning? Image result for gradient boosting algorithm Gradient boosting Regression calculates the difference between the current prediction and the known correct target value. This difference is called residual. After that Gradient boosting Regression trains a weak model that maps features to that residual.
